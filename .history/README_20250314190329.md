# Contacts Application (React Native + SQLite)

This project is a simple guide application developed using React Native to understand and experience the SQLite database structure.
It is designed to learn basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SQLite and to practice database management.

## SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to interact with databases. SQLite is an embedded database management system that can run on the device without the need for a server. It is often preferred when there is a need for local data storage in React Native projects.
